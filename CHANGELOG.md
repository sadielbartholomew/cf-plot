*Note*: stated dates of releases correspond to the date a given

### Version `3.4.X`, first released (`3.4.0`) `2025-04-28`

#### Version `3.4.0`, release soon (date `2025-04-28`)

* Move of codebase home from old repository location of `github.com/ajheaps/cf-plot` to
  `github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot` - the former URL will redirect for the time being
  but cannot be guaranteed to do so in future
* Move of home for documentation: now and going forward hosted permanently at
  `ncas-cms.github.io/cf-plot/` with the previous documentation at root URL
  `ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot/` frozen (no longer updated so do not consult)
* Documentation overhaul including new responsive theme, hierarchical structuring,
   improved navigation, listing of all examples grouped by theme with reorganisation
   of gallery view, updates for informational pages, and more
* New feature: `traj` method can now natively plot *single* trajectories
(i.e. one-dimensional paths, having no trajectory dimension) encoded as
  discrete sampling geometries (https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot/issues/84)
* Fix bug whereby `con` contour plot with `verbose=True` would result in
   an `UnboundLocalError` (https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot/issues/54)
* Fix bug whereby plots such as with `con` using the 'merc' Mercator projection
    would be cropped to small portion of the y axis
    (https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot/issues/65)
* Fix bug whereby the colour bar would be mostly cutoff from the foot of
  the figure for plots such as `con` contour plots when using certain projections
  such as 'ortho', 'merc', and 'lcc' after a call to e.g. `cfp.mapset(proj='ortho')`
  (https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot/issues/70)
* Fix bug whereby `con` contour plot in the 'UKCP' projection would
     result in an `IndexError` for `blockfill=True`
     (https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot/issues/91) or otherwise an
     `UnboundLocalError` (https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot/issues/60)
     or an `AttributeError` (https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot/issues/59)
     dependent on other configuration
* Fix bug whereby `con` would result in a blank plot for rotated pole data
  requested for display on its native grid through setting of `cfp.mapset(proj="rotated")`
  (see https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot/issues/86)
* Fix bug whereby values at the colour bar extremes in blockfill plots (`con` with
  `blockfill=True`) with `blockfill_fast=None` default would always be shown in white
  (see https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot/issues/98)
* Fix bug whereby blockfill plots (`con` with `blockfill=True`) of UGRID data in either polar
  projection (`proj="npstere"` or `proj="spstere"`) could display blacked out areas
  (see https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot/issues/99)
* Make consistent the defaults for `feature_zorder` and
   `rotated_grid_thickness` plotting variables as configurable through `setvars`
   (https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot/issues/73)
* Set new minimum version of dependency: `'cf-python >= 3.17.0'`
* Set new minimum version of dependency: `'cartopy >= 0.17.0'`
* Removed explicit (listed) dependency to `matplotlib` since this is required already by
  existing dependency Cartopy
* Removed explicit (listed) dependency to `scipy` since this is required already by existing
  dependency cf-python
