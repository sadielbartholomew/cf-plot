Training material
*****************

We run semi-regular training courses on, or including major components on,
cf-python and cf-plot, including:

* `'Data Analysis Tools' course <https://ncas.ac.uk/study-with-us/data-analysis-tools/>`_;
* `'Introduction to Scientific Computing' course <https://ncas.ac.uk/study-with-us/introduction-to-scientific-computing/>`_.

The training material is openly-accessible and can be worked through in
one's own time. Links to this are as follows:

* Repository with instructions: https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-tools-training
* 'New course' which is the most recent form of the course and has been
  updated for more recent verisons of cf-python and cf-plot, hence is the
  **recommended sub-directory to use** for training with the repository as-is.

The training is mostly in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. See the
`set-up guidance here <https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-tools-training?tab=readme-ov-file#downloading-and-working-through-the-course>`_
for support with getting started using the Notebooks for learning.
