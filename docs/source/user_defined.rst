User-defined axes
*****************

Some plots may need to be re-labelled to avoid overly dense or sparse
labels. The following pair of examples illustrate the 'before and after' of
this case.

.. include:: examples/example_20.rst


.. include:: examples/example_21a.rst

In this plot the axes are labelled with the ``axes`` keyword before
making a contour map of the data. The ``xticklabels`` and ``yticklabels``
options can be used to fine tune the axis labels.
