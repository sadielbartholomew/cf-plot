Overview
########

cf-plot allows you to produce and customise publication-quality contour, vector,
line and more plots with the power of Python, `matplotlib`_,
`Cartopy`_ and `cf-python`_ in as few lines of code as possible.

It is designed to be a useful visualisation tool for environmental, earth and
aligned sciences, for example to facilitate climate and meteorological research.
cf-plot is developed and maintained by the `NCAS-CMS`_ group, part of `NCAS`_.
