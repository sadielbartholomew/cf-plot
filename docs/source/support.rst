Support and contributing
************************

Ways to contact us
------------------

If you find an apparent issue with cf-plot or have a question or feature
request etc., the *preferred* method of contact is via the
`GitHub Issue Tracker for the cf-plot repository <https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot/issues>`_.
You will need a GitHub account to do this, but it is free to
`sign up <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github>`_.

If you don't want to use the Issue Tracker then you can also either:

* send an email to Sadie Bartholomew at `sadie.bartholomew@ncas.ac.uk` (or
  if based on the University of Reading campus you may find her in-office
  HP113, noting she often works from home);
* post on the `NCAS-CMS Helpdesk <https://cms-helpdesk.ncas.ac.uk/>`_.

If you are reporting an issue, please follow the guidelines below so that
we have enough information to attempt to recreate the problem.


Contributing guidelines
-----------------------

.. These should be kept identical to the CONTRIBUTING.md except in .rst
   format. It is simplest to write into CONTRIBUTING.md, use a markdown
   to RST converter and then copy and paste that in. So, don't edit this
   section directly!

We have a dedicated
`contributing document <https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-python/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_
which outlines guidance for contributing. This information has also been
included below for ease of reference.
