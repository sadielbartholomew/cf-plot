Projections in cf-plot
**********************

The cylindrical and polar stereographic projections are detailed
separately in `cylindrical plots <cylindrical>` and `polar plots <polar>`.

cf-plot looks for auxiliary coordinates of longitude and latitude and
uses them if found. If they aren't present then cf-plot will generate
the grid required using the `projection_x_coordinate` and
`projection_y_coordinate` variables.

For a blockfill plot it uses the latter method and the
supplied bounds.

`cfp.setvars` options affecting the grid plotting for the UKCP grid are:

| grid=True - draw grid
| grid_spacing=1 - grid spacing in degrees
| grid_colour='black' - grid colour
| grid_linestyle='--' - grid line style
| grid_thickness=1.0 - grid thickness

Here we changed the plotted grid with the grid_colour option to
`cfp.setvars`, `xticks` and `yticks` options to `cfp.con`
and make a blockfill plot.
